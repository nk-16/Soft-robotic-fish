# Soft-robotic-fish
Worked on an ideation competition named Biognosis on biomimicry by Shaastra, IIT Madras, where I presented my idea of soft robotic fish. I came under the top 10 individuals Nation Wide in this. In this, I worked on biomimicry to develop a unique solution whose target application will be SDG goal 14 - Life Below Water. My idea is based on how aquatic organisms tackle this issue of water pollution. I explained my idea through 5 points - 

DEFINE
It is the impact I want my design to have in the world and the criteria and constraints that will determine success.

BIOLOGIZE
I analyzed the essential functions and context my design solution must address. I tried to connect my idea with nature.

DISCOVER
I looked for natural models (organisms and ecosystems) that must address the same functions and context as my design solution. 

ABSTRACT
I studied the essential features or mechanisms that make biological strategies successful. I restated them in non-biological terms as “design strategies.”

EMULATE
I looked for patterns and relationships among the strategies I found and tried to relate them to my solution. I developed design concepts based on these elements.
